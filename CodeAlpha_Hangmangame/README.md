**Task 1: Hangman Game**



**Description**



This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed in Python.

The player has to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.



The game allows only 6 incorrect guesses. If the player guesses the word before reaching 6 wrong attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose.



This project is suitable for intermediate-level Python students and uses basic programming concepts.



**Features**



* Random word selection



* Limited incorrect attempts



* Console-based input/output



* Simple and beginner-friendly logic



**Concepts Used**



* random module



* while loop



* if-else statements



* strings



* lists



* input() and print()



* break statement



**How to Run**
