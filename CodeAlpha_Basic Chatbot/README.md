**CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship – Task 4**



**Task Name**



Basic Chatbot



**Description**



This project is a beginner-friendly chatbot developed in Python.

It works on a rule-based system where the program checks what the user types and replies with a fixed response.



The chatbot understands simple messages like greetings, small talk questions, and exit commands. It continues chatting until the user decides to stop.



**Functionality**



* Accepts text input from the user through the keyboard



* Converts user input to lowercase for easy comparison



* Uses decision-making statements to identify matching keywords



* Responds with predefined messages



* Stops running when the user types an exit word like "bye"



**Concepts Used**



* String methods (lower() for case-insensitive matching)



* Decision-making (if, elif, else)



* Infinite loop using while True



* break statement to exit loop



* Basic console interaction using input() and print()
